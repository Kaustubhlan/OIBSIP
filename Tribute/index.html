            <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar  born 24 April 1973 is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national
                 team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI 
                 and Test cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total. He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match
                  awards in international cricket. Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world', 
                  Tendulkar is sometimes referred to as "The God of Cricket" in India. A film with that name was released in 2021.</p>
